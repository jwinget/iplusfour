They’re really good slides and I highly recommend flipping through them.\n@datalorax even has a package in development called slidex that converts the content of a PowerPoint to Rmarkdown, but what about the theme? I don’t have a magic package to solve this issue, but I thought I’d outline some steps I use to re-create PowerPoint themes in Xaringan. This is useful if you have an organizational/departmental theme that you need to use, but would rather have the reproducibility and feature set of Rmarkdown/Xaringan.\nIf you haven’t done so already, follow the instructions to install Xaringan.\nCreate a package to hold your template(s)\rMost departmental templates are going to have a small user base (maybe just you…), so they don’t really need to be contributed back to Xaringan. I think the best solution is to create a personal package to hold the templates which you can share within your organization as needed.\nif (!require(usethis)) {install.packages(\u0026#39;usethis\u0026#39;)}\rlibrary(usethis)\r# Change the path below for your file system\rpkgpath \u0026lt;- \u0026#39;E:/Code/mytemplates\u0026#39;\rusethis::create_package(pkgpath)\rThis should create a package and open it in a new Rstudio session.

Here is a pretty simple Xaringan skeleton (sample text from Cat Ipsum:\n---\rtitle: \u0026quot;PRESENTATION TITLE\u0026quot;\rsubtitle: \u0026quot;SUBTITLE\u0026quot;\rauthor: \u0026quot;Jason Winget\u0026quot;\rdate: \u0026quot;`r Sys.Date()`\u0026quot;\routput:\rxaringan::moon_reader:\rcss: [default, \u0026#39;mytemplate.css\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;myfonts.css\u0026#39;]\rlib_dir: libs\rnature:\rratio: \u0026quot;16:9\u0026quot;\rhighlightStyle: github\rcountIncrementalSlides: false\r---\r# First slide title\rLion.

Tomcat lynx, yet american bobtail cornish rex for balinese for russian blue so egyptian mau. Siberian ragdoll, for maine coon turkish angora. Russian blue mouser leopard and himalayan. Bombay bombay yet american bobtail maine coon.\r]\rYou should set up this skeleton with some standard structure that you often have in a presentation. Every presentation you create will start with whatever is in this file, so it’s very helpful to include a link to Xaringan docs and some simple examples of markdown/layout.\nFor example, I like to include an R setup block that loads the tidyverse, DT, and other packages as well as sets knitr chunk options. Save this file as skeleton.Rmd in the skeleton directory we made above.\nNotice in the skeleton header we reference two css files: mytemplate.css and myfonts.css. Those will be where we create the style later. For now just create two empty files in the same directory as skeleton.Rmd\nNext we need to create a template.yaml file in the folder named DeptPPT above (or whatever you’ve renamed it to). This is a simple file that just looks like the following:\nname: Department PPT\rdescription: A recreation of the departmental PowerPoint template\r\rMake sure to put a newline at the bottom of this file.\nThis is the name that will show up in the Rstudio menus when you create a new document.\nOK, now let’s install our package.\nif (!require(remotes)) {install.packages(\u0026#39;remotes\u0026#39;)}\rlibrary(remotes)\rremotes::install_local(pkgpath)\rRestart your R session Ctrl+Shift+F10, then go to File \u0026gt; New File\u0026gt; R Markdown, click “From Template” on the bottom left, then input a title and select a directory. Since the template has associated CSS files, it will create a new directory to hold itself. You should get a new tab in Rstudio containing a copy of the skeleton.Rmd file we made above.\nFor now, just knit the skeleton and open it in a web browser. After knitting, open the myfonts.css and mytemplate.css files that are created in the new directory (not the empty files we made above).\n\rRecreating a theme\rOK, I don’t know what your departmental theme looks like, so I’m going to reproduce part of this iago theme just to give an example of how to go about it. Now we’re going to have to get our hands dirty with CSS, but usually you can go pretty far with a few simple rules.\nLet’s start with the easy part, the fonts. This theme helpfully tells us that it uses “Abel”, which is available on Google Fonts.\nGo to the open myfonts.css and add the following lines:\n@import url(\u0026#39;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Abel\u0026#39;);\rbody { font-family: \u0026#39;Abel\u0026#39;, sans-serif; }\rSave the file and refresh the slides in the browser. You should see that the fonts have all changed to Abel! One cool thing about CSS changes is that we don’t have to re-knit to see them. If you don’t see Abel fonts, make sure you’re connected to the internet and that you added the lines to the right myfonts.css file.\nOK, now let’s really get into it by working on mytemplate.css.\rOne thing that helps a lot here is the inspect feature in Google Chrome. Press Ctrl+Shift+I in your browser to pull up this window. You can hover over the HTML to see where the display comes from.\nFirst let’s fix the text and background image/colors. First I used a screenshot (Prt Scr) and Paint to get a clean version of the background image. I saved this in the presentation folder as background.png. You might be able to save this straight out of your template. Next we edit mytemplate.css.\nI also used the color selector in GIMP to get the primary dark purple background color\n.remark-slide-content {\rbackground: url(\u0026#39;background.png\u0026#39;) #0F0027;\rbackground-size: contain;\rbackground-repeat: no-repeat;\rbackground-position: right bottom;\r}\rbody {\rcolor: white;\r}\rh1 {\rcolor: #ef007e;\r}\ra {\rcolor: #ff8700\r}\rEven with just these few rules we’re already kind of close!\nLet’s move the slide numbers to the top right and make them orange. Still working in mytemplate.css:\n.remark-slide-number {\rposition: absolute;\rtop: 1em;\rright: 1em;\rcolor: #ff8700;\ropacity: 1;\r}\rTo change the format to just show the current slide number, we have to edit the YAML header at the top of our presentation:\nnature:\rslideNumberFormat: \u0026quot;%current%\u0026quot;\rAnd re-knit to see the change, since we changed the Rmd.\nThat should get you started with CSS. Let’s clean up the title slide and wrap up this blog post.\nAgain, I took a screenshot of the title slide background and saved it as title_bg.png in the presentation folder. Then we just need to set some styles on the title:\n.title-slide {\rbackground: url(\u0026#39;title_bg.png\u0026#39;) #0F0027;\rbackground-size: contain;\r}\r.title-slide h1, .title-slide h2, .title-slide h3 {\rfont-weight: 100;\rcolor: #ef007e;\r}\r.title-slide h1 {\rfont-size: 5rem;\r}\r.title-slide .remark-slide-number {\rdisplay: none;\r}\r\rWrapping up\rOnce you’re happy with the look, copy the images, mytemplate.css and myfonts.css files into their counterparts within the package we created at the beginning. You might also want to overwrite the content of skeleton.Rmd with any changes made, like the slide number formatting.\nYou’ll also need to reinstall the package every time you update it.\nWhew, we made it! That ended up being kind of wordy, but it’s really not too challenging. Give it a try, and tweet me @iplusfour if you have any issues.\nOnce you’re happy with the template, make sure to version control your package! You can easily add more Rmarkdown templates to the same package by creating new directories under /inst/rmarkdown/templates. I have some for detailed team reports, summary documents, etc.\nStay awesome!\n\r","date":1548892800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548892800,"objectID":"ff83cd75768465f94096d4a6a5917e84","permalink":"https://iplusfour.netlify.com/post/reproducing-powerpoint-templates-in-xaringan/","publishdate":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/reproducing-powerpoint-templates-in-xaringan/","section":"post","summary":"I recently read this tweet from @apreshill that linked to some slides by datalorax covering how to make custom themes for Xaringan, my favorite Rmarkdown presentation package.

Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target. Results on the BIWI dataset are preliminary but encouraging. Further evaluation and demonstration of the system will be available on our website.","tags":[],"title":"A Person Re-Identification System For Mobile Devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["GA Cushen","MS Nixon"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1372651200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1372651200,"objectID":"2b4d919e3cf73dfcd0063c88fe01cb00","permalink":"https://iplusfour.netlify.com/publication/clothing-search/","publishdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/clothing-search/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a mobile visual clothing search system whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking photo or take a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a retail database. From the query image, the person is detected, clothing is segmented, and clothing features are extracted and quantized. The information is sent from the phone client to a server, where the feature vector of the query image is used to retrieve similar clothing products from online databases. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location. State of the art work focuses primarily on the recognition of a diverse range of clothing offline and pays little attention to practical applications. Evaluated on a challenging dataset, the system is relatively fast and achieves promising results.","tags":[],"title":"Mobile visual clothing search","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne\r Two\r Three\r\nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
