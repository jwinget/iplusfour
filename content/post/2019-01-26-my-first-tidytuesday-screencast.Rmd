Like they say, long journeys start with a single step. This is my first time looking at a [#TidyTuesday](https://thomasmock.netlify.com/post/tidytuesday-a-weekly-social-data-project-in-r/) dataset and my first time doing an R screencast.

This week's data is on incarceration in the US, and in just a short exploration I find some interesting features.
