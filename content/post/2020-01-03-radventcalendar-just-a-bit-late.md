In early December I came across an [R advent calendar](https://kiirstio.wixsite.com/kowen/post/the-25-days-of-christmas-an-r-advent-calendar) for new users that was created by @KiirstiO, and decided it would be nice to do fairly short videos where I worked through the exercises in case folks got stuck.

Obviously the calendar is over now, but I think it's still a nice, gentle introduction to R for anyone who might be new. Check out the source materials above, and my YouTube playlist can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms7u9jvkjNI&list=PLXjgHAp5I5UhV7nw1eY61_Uil68KhmBKe)
