<p>Got a question today about how to write a data frame to Excel without rownames. Seasoned R vets probably don’t even blink at this, but it’s the type of thing that I think a lot of new users struggle to overcome.</p>
<p>Anyhow, here are my quick and simple solutions:</p>
<p>The easiest is to write this to a CSV file, which will open in excel. You can use the following code to do this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Install/load the readr package
if(!require(readr)){
    install.packages(&quot;readr&quot;)
    library(readr)
}

# Write out the file
write_csv(my.data.frame, “mytable.csv”)</code></pre>
<p>Once again the <code>tidyverse</code> comes to the rescue. <code>write_csv</code> from the readr package never writes row names to the output file!</p>
<p>Alternatively you could write directly to an excel document using <code>XLConnect</code>. This code would look more like the following:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Install/load the XLConnect package
if(!require(XLConnect)){
    install.packages(&quot;XLConnect &quot;)
    library(XLConnect)
}

# Create an output workbook
wb &lt;- loadWorkbook(“myfile.xlsx”, create=TRUE)

# Create a sheet named results in the new workbook
createSheet(wb, ‘results’)

# Write your table to the sheet
writeWorksheet(wb, my.data.frame, ‘results’)

# Save the file
saveWorkbook(wb)</code></pre>
<p>There you have it, pretty easy once you know the tools. Keep being awesome!</p>
